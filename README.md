# 30-days-js-challenge
This repository contains my code and projects for a 30-day JavaScript challenge led by Hitesh Choudhary. Each day covers a specific JavaScript topic, includes quizzes, and features a small project to reinforce the day's learning. Follow along as I enhance my JavaScript skills with hands-on exercises and real-world projects.
